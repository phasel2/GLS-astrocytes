# Defining the molecular identity and morphology of _glia limitans     superficialis_ astrocytes in vertebrates

Here you can find the code to recreate the figures from this manuscript currently under review.

In the meantime, you can find the preprint 
[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535893v1). The figure panels currently don't overlap between the preprint and the manuscript under review.

## Main findings

We discovered that specialized astrocytes make up the surface of the central nervous system. This is conserved across species from fish to humans. In mouse, monkey and humans, 
the brain surface is created by the cell bodies of astrocytes positive for the marker _Myocilin_. These astrocytes have a stalk that penetrates the parenchyma as well as superficial processes
that interact with superfical blood vessels.

Light sheet miscroscopy (credit: Melissa L. Cooper) of an Aldh1l1-eGFP mouse shows the cell bodies of _glia limitans superficialis_ astrocytes and their parenchymal processes.

It is crucial to understand that there are _Gfap_ positive astrocytes that reside in Layer 1 of the mouse cortex that are often incorrectly referred to as _glia limitans_ astrocytes.
It is actually _Myoc_ positive astrocytes creating the superficial _glia limitans_ with their cell bodies.

## Recovering small sub-populations of astrocytes using the integration of published single cell data sets

Data sets used to extract the small population of _glia limitans superficialis_ astrocytes can be found in the supplemental table and below:
